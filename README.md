# Console Properties
This program shows how to change console properteries like the console position, size, and top most property. This program was created using C++. The main OS this program will focus on is windows. However, the Clear command will explain how to clear the console for Linux and Apple devices.

For convenience purposes, all the commands will be put into one cpp file. The commands that will be included are: two clear functions, an always on top function, a not always on top function, a set position function, and a set size function.

An executable file will also be included to showcase the commands in action. This program was mainly created because fancy GUI's and UI's are not always neccessary to make. Sometimes just having a simple light-weight console window will suffice. By using these functions, it can help usability by allowing more customization to suit one's preferences.
